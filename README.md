# SVS_SliderUnlock revived

The credit of SliderUnlock functionalities goes to the original author @Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. I am just doing porting stuff.

The SVS_SliderUnlock is now made portable by using byte pattern searches to locate patching anchors. However if this stop working for future version of SVS, the updates is not guaranteed unless it's just some simple byte pattern changes.
